# Titanic Survival Prediction – Machine Learning Project

## About the Project
This project focuses on predicting whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster using Machine Learning techniques.

The Titanic dataset is widely used for learning Machine Learning because it contains real-world passenger data such as age, gender, passenger class, fare, and embarkation point.  
Using this dataset, different Machine Learning models are trained to predict survival outcomes.
